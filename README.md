# Nigerian-Cities-Clustering-
A location based  cluster of some Nigerian cities

Made use of latitude and Longitude data for 30 popular Nigerian Cities and then used a KMeans Cluster to Group cities using their euclidean distance 

## Visualization

```python
{'Lagos': 3,
 'Kano': 2,
 'Ibadan': 3,
 'Abuja': 0,
 'Port Harcourt': 4,
 'Benin City': 3,
 'Maiduguri': 1,
 'Zaria': 2,
 'Aba': 4,
 'Jos': 0,
 'Ilorin': 3,
 'Oyo': 3,
 'Enugu': 4,
 'Abeokuta': 3,
 'Onitsha': 4,
 'Warri': 4,
 'Okene': 3,
 'Calabar': 4,
 'Uyo': 4,
 'Sokoto': 2,
 'Akure': 3,
 'Osogbo': 3,
 'Lafia': 0,
 'Ado Ekiti': 3,
 'Gusau': 2,
 'Awka': 4,
 'Ijebu Ode': 3,
 'Ondo': 3,
 'Iseyin': 3,
 'Gombe': 1}

```


We can kind of deduce some geo-political zones like:
* South-West : Orange
* South-south/South-east : Brown
* North-east: Green

Other classes are kind of indeducible but still fall under their respective geo-political zone


The data looks better suited to 3 clusters , I believe that could have been a better representation
