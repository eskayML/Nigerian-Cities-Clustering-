# Nigerian-Cities-Clustering-
A location based  cluster of some Nigerian cities

Made use of latitude and Longitude data for 30 popular Nigerian Cities and then used a KMeans Cluster to Group cities using their euclidean distance 

## Visualization

We can kind of deduce some geo-political zones like:
* South-West : Purple
* North-west : Orange
* North-east: Green

Other classes are kind of indeducible but still fall under their respective geo-political zone


The data looks better suited to 3 clusters , I believe that could have been a better representation
